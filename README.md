You have lots of apps on your Mac and donâ€™t know how to uninstall them? The following article will show you the best way to uninstall apps from your Mac and keep your Mac in good condition all the time. Here we go!


## Open Finder

* Finder is the default file manager used on a Mac.
* To open it, click the Finder icon in your Dock. 
* If you don't see the Finder icon, click the magnifying glass in the upper-right corner of your screen and type Finder into the search bar. 
* Once you open Finder, you should see all of your files and folders listed on the left side of the window.



## Select the Apps You Want to Delete

* To delete an app, first click and hold its icon. 
* Then, click the X that appears in the upper-left corner of the app. 
* You can also delete an app from Launchpad. 
* To do this, press and hold the Option key, then click and hold the app's icon until it begins to jiggle.
* Click the X that appears in the upper-left corner of the app's icon, then click Delete when prompted.


## Drag and Drop the App Icon into Trash

* To uninstall an app, the first thing you need to do is find the app you want to delete. 
* Once you have found the app, make sure it's not running by quitting all open instances of it. 
* To do this, right-click (or Control-click) its icon in the Dock and choose Quit from the shortcut menu that appears.

## Empty Trash

Whenever you delete an app, it doesn't immediately disappear from your Mac. The app is still in your Trash, taking up space until you empty the Trash.

**Here's how to get rid of it for good:** 

1. Open the Trash. 
2. Select the app you want to delete.
